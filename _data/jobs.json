        "summary": "Working at Neptik was my first real experience at an agency. I joined as an intern through a European Program funded by the EU. At Neptik I worked in a team of 4 designers / developers. During my time there I was able to develop various wordpress sites, from design to deployment in autonomy. This experience taught me a lot about agency life, how to communicate with designers and clients as well as technical skills such as git and technologies like Vagrant and Grunt."

        "summary": "I joined Bozboz a week after my internship ended at Neptik. I spent an amazing six months there. The company is bigger so the structure was different. Working there helped me to significantly improve my communication skills with Account Managers and Digital Marketing executives. I learned to listen to their concerns on certain projects, clearly articulate my thoughts and explain my tasks. On the technical side, I worked alongside incredibly talented developers who exposed me to PHP, Laravel, SSH and a host of other cool technologies."
