<section class="about animated-section"><h2 class="section-header">Some Basics</h2><article class="about__blurb"><p>Thanks for stopping by ! My name is Karim Cheurfi (pronounced she-ri-fi, blame the French). I'm a 24 years old front end geek discovering the wonderful world of full stack development. I live between Brighton, Paris and London and write Javascript and Python.</p><p>I'm a self proclaimed Milkshake expert who enjoys bringing life to beautiful designs, creating interactions and animations with my code. I like Sonic the Hedgehog, Javascript, Django and Arsenal. I despise Tottenham and unsemantic markup. I also probably make too many AJAX calls.</p><p>In my free time, when I'm not hanging out with friends, taking pictures or trying to come up with potential valid reasons for the lack of spending at Arsenal, I like to experiment with code and try new frameworks and technologies (Recently Django, ExpressJS and Angular). </p><p>Oh, and I studied Business Administration and Digital Marketing at the university of Paris.</p></article></section>
