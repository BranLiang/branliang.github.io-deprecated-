<section class="about"><h2 class="section-heading"><span>bran@liang:~$</span><span> whoami</span></h2><article class="about__text"><p>My name is Bran Liang(梁博渊️), I'm a 26 years old full stack
developer based in Shanghai (currently) and Nanjing (Home), China.
I like coding at <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>, and you
can find me there at <a href="https://github.com/Branliang">My Profile</a>.</p><p>I'm a <span> passionate cyber nerd </span> with great interest in
open source and devops. In my free time I like to hack on fun
projects, play / watch films with friends, exploring interesting places in
Shanghai. I am also a little bit alcholic, so if you happen to be in Shanghai,
it would be more than happy for me to have a drink🍺 with you somewhere.</p></article></section>
