<section class="about"><h2 class="section-heading"><span>ubuntu@zabana:~$</span><span> whoami</span></h2><article class="about__text"><p>My name is Karim Cheurfi, I'm 25 years old and I'm a full stack developer
based in Paris, France (currently) and Brighton, UK.
In Paris, I connect people together at <a href="https://numa.co">Numa</a>,
and when I'm in Brighton I mentor under-represented students at <a href="https://codebar.io/">Codebar.</a></p><p>I'm a massive cyberpunk nerd with an interest in Open Source and Photography. In my free
time I like to hack on fun projects, play / watch football with friends, gulp banana smoothies while
reading Hacker News and cycle (among other things, like obsessing over my .vimrc config).</p></article></section>
