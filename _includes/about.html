developer | based in Paris, France (currently) and Brighton, UK.
In Paris, I connect people together at
<a href="https://numa.co">Numa</a>, and when I'm in Brighton I
mentor under-represented students at

open source and devops. In my free time I like to hack on fun
projects, play / watch football with friends, gulp banana
smoothies while reading Hacker News and cycle (among other things,
like obsessing over my .vimrc config).</p></article></section>
