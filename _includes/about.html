<section class="about"><div class="about__picture"></div><article class="about__blurb"><p>Hey there, thanks for stopping by ! My name is Karim Cheurfi (pronounced she-ri-fi, blame the French). I'm a 24 year old front end geek discovering the wonderful world of full stack development. I live between Brighton, Paris and London and write Javascript and Python (that rhymed)</p><p>I'm a self proclaimed Cereals expert who enjoys bringing beautiful designs to life, creating interactions and animations with my code. I like Sonic the Hedgehog, Javascript, Django and Arsenal. I despise Tottenham and unsemantic markup. I make too many AJAX calls and write git ass more than any programmer should. </p><p>In my free time, when I'm not hanging out with friends, taking pictures and trying to come up with potential valid reasons why arsenal was unable to win the league in a decade, I like to experiment with code and try new frameworks and techniques (Recently Django and React). Oh and I studied Business Administration and Digital Marketing at the university of Paris.</p></article></section>
