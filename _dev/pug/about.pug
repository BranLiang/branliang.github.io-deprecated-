            | My name is Karim Cheurfi, I'm 25 years old and I'm a full stack
            | developer | based in Paris, France (currently) and Brighton, UK.
            | In Paris, I connect people together at
            | <a href="https://numa.co">Numa</a>, and when I'm in Brighton I
            | mentor under-represented students at
            | <a href="https://codebar.io/">Codebar</a>.

            | I'm a <span> massive cyberpunk nerd </span> with an interest in
            | open source and devops. In my free time I like to hack on fun
            | projects, play / watch football with friends, gulp banana
            | smoothies while reading Hacker News and cycle (among other things,
            | like obsessing over my .vimrc config).
