My name is Karim and I'm a Front-end Developer from Paris based in Brighton, UK. I currently work at Neptik, a young and creative digital agency where I do Front-end development, SEO and social media management.

I'm a self proclaimed milkshake expert with a masters degree in Digital Marketing. I enjoy giving life to beautiful designs, creating interactions and animations with my code. I like Sonic The Hedgehog, Harvey Specter and Arsenal. I despise Tottenham and unsemantic markup. In my free time, when I'm not exploring the city, I like to work on my really cool personal projects, including a SASS powered animation library called Smoothie.

I also like to play around and experiment with new languages, frameworks and technologies. Recently, I've been obsessed with Jade, Plain Javascript and AJAX Requests. (Frameworks like Meteor and Angular are also on my "to-learn" list.)
