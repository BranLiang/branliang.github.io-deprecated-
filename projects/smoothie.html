<p>Smoothie was created because I wanted to challenge myself and see If I could write an entire library on my own.</p>

<p>I wrote it when I was at Neptik and is entirely written in Sass (indented syntax, not Scss).</p>

<p>It's also not prefixed because at the time I assumed everyone was using some sort of autoprefixer.</p>

<p>I still use it to this day but I haven't really added much to it as I focused more on Javascript, Node and Python.</p>

<p>Again, it's open source so If you want to contribute to it, you're more than welcome !</p>
