This is a project I started (and completed) with no other purpose than trying to learn to interact with 'real' apis. I had experience making ajax calls but I really wanted to create something useful with a real practical application.

I was inspired to pursue this project after watching a youtube series where the host designs and codes his new portfolio site from scratch. I noticed that he hard-coded links to his Dribbble shots so I wanted to see if it was possible to pull that information dynamically.

Working on this portfolio site pushed me to learn about Promises in ES6, the Promise.all method, It even taught me a little bit about oAuth and how to set headers to authenticate requests. All in all It was a really fun learning experience.

In addition, I added a Google Map to the site for fun with a custom SVG marker. I styled the map using this wonderful app called [snazzymaps](https://snazzymaps.com/).
