<p>Milky is essentially my version of the HTML5 boilerplate. I created it because I realised that I was spending too much time setting up projects and not enough time actually working on them.</p>

<p>It started as a very simple front end starter kit with HTML5, SASS (indented syntax, Bourbon and Neat) and Javascript. I added Gulp as a build tool to compile my SASS and minify my Javascript Code. In addition, I incorporated Browser-Sync for live reloading (and to have a basic web server).</p>

<p>Milky evolved as my needs started to change. I adopted the ES6 standard so I needed a way to modularise my code and for that I chose browserify and babel. I also integrated Jade, Handlebars and React into the mix. It's very lightweight and will probably continue to change with my future needs.</p>

<p>I encourage you to check it out and contribute to it if you find it useful !</p>
