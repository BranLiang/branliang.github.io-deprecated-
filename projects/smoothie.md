Smoothie was created because I wanted to challenge myself and see If I could write an entire library on my own.

I wrote it when I was at Neptik and is entirely written in Sass (indented syntax, not Scss).

It's also not prefixed because at the time I assumed everyone was using some sort of autoprefixer.

I still use it to this day but I haven't really added much to it as I focused more on Javascript, Node and Python.

Again, it's open source so If you want to contribute to it, you're more than welcome !
