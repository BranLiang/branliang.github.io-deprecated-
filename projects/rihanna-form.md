Now this is a really fun one. After learning so much about Promises and ES6, I felt unstoppable and decided to push myself to learn Regular Expressions (which I swore to myself I would never learn because I was too afraid).

One of the most common use cases I found for Regex is form validation. For this project, I used and coded a Design created by Mackenzie Child for his youtube series. Full credit goes to him for this beautiful piece.

This helped me improve my knowledge of RegEx, specifically how to write patterns and check if there is a match. In addition, I can now better control user input on forms and I got to experiment with Javascript Audio.

WARNING: Turn down the volume after successfully submitting the form ^^
