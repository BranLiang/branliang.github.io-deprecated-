<p>After a million AJAX calls, I finally realised that I had a thing for Data Manipulation. That lead me to teach myself Python (after buying a Raspberry PI) and SQL. I immediately fell in love with Python and its beautiful syntax and I decided that it was time for me to pick a framework.
    </p>
<p>The choice wasn't easy between Django and Flask, but I eventually picked Django mainly for the documentation that I find quite clear and straightforward. Cereal Notes is basically me Teaching myself all kinds of fun things related to the framework. I absolutely love it.</p>

<p>Because of that, I was able to learn about data processing through forms and POST requests, how to filter data based on URL parameters, how to register / login-out users, HttpResponses, template context etc. I'm also trying to build a RESTful service for it. We'll see how it goes !</p>

<p>The project is still in development, it will soon be deployed on heroku. In the meantime, you can check the progress by visiting the repo's page.</p>
