<p>After a million AJAX calls, I finally realised that I had a thing for Data Manipulation. That led me to teach myself Python (after buying a Raspberry PI) and SQL. I immediately fell in love with Python and its beautiful syntax and I decided that it was time for me to pick a framework.</p>

<p>The choice wasn't easy between Django and Flask, but I eventually picked Django mainly for the documentation that I find quite clear and straightforward (and the active community / overall support). Cereal Notes is basically me having fun and learning all kinds of things related to the framework. I absolutely love it.</p>

<p>Because of that, I was able to learn about data processing through forms and POST requests, how to filter data based on URL parameters, how to register / login-out users, HttpResponses, template context etc. I'm also trying to build a RESTful service for it. We'll see how it goes !</p>

<p>I also want to learn advanced user registration, Facebook / Twitter / Google+ authentication and secure form validation.</p>

<p>Working on this site also made me appreciate front-end frameworks like bootstrap even more. I spent a significant amount of time writing the styles when using bootstrap / foundation would have been a better solution, as the focus for me was centered around the back-end aspects and not necessarily the presentation.</p>

<p>The project is still in development, it is now deployed on heroku. It's a pre pre-alpha prototype. It will improve as a I expand my knowledge of the framework. There's a link to the repo below if you want to have a look at the source code !</p>
