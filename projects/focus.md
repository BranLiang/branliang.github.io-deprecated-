The Javascript Audio API had been sitting on my 'to learn' list for too long so I decided to do something about it. Focus is pretty much a clone of noisli, an app I use quite frequently that helps me get into the zone and get work done.

So I went on dribble to find inspiration and came up with Focus. The idea is literally the same as noisli. You can play a track, stop it, go to the next or previous one and change the volume using the range input.

I'm quite happy with the end result and really enjoyed working on this. It's fully functional so you can try it out if you want !
