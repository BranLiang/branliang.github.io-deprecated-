<p>This is a project I started (and completed) with no other purpose than trying to learn to interact with 'real' apis. I had experience making ajax calls but I really wanted to create something useful with a real practical application.</p>

<p>I was inspired to pursue this project after watching a youtube series where the host designs and codes his new portfolio site from scratch. I noticed that he hard-coded links to his Dribbble shots so I wanted to see if it was possible to pull that information dynamically.</p>

<p>Working on this portfolio site pushed me to learn about Promises in ES6, the Promise.all method, It even taught me a little bit about oAuth and how to set headers to authenticate requests. All in all It was a really fun learning experience.</p>

<p>In addition, I added a Google Map to the site for fun with a custom SVG marker. I styled the map using this wonderful app called <a href="https://snazzymaps.com/">Snazzy Maps.</a></p>
